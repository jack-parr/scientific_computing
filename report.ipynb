    "### 1 - Summary of Software\n",
    "This section outlines the capabilities of the software package, by detailing the methods incorporated into each file and providing examples of applying the functions and comparing their accuracies against known true solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 - ode_solver.py\n",
    "The goal is to produce a software capable of solving single and multi-dimensional systems of ODEs, utilising the Euler and 4th Order Runga-Kutta (RK4) methods integration methods to solve the solution at timesteps. A maximum timestep can be specified which impacts the number of steps the algorithm must take. The first example shows the *solve_to* function evaluating the ODE equation $\\dot{x} = x$, with initial condition $x(0) = 1, t \\in [0,1]$, and $\\Delta t_{max} = 0.05$. Solutions to $x(1)$ are found using Euler and RK4 integration. These are compared to the known solution $x(t) = e^t$ as shown in Figure X. This plot shows the solutions generated using RK4 are accurate enough to be obscured on the graph, while Euler method results in a small under-approximation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The *solve_to* function is also capable of evaluating systems of ODEs. To demonstrate this, the next example solves the ODE $\\ddot{x} = x$, which is equivalent to the system $\\dot{x} = y, \\dot{y} = -x$. The same initial conditions are used, with $x(0) = [1,1], t \\in [0,10]$, and $\\Delta t_{max} = 0.01$. Solutions to $x(5)$ are found and compared to the known solutions $x(t) = cos(t) + sin(t), y(t) = cos(t) - sin(t)$, as shown in Figure X. For this problem, Euler and RK4 appear to perform similarly with the reduced $\\Delta t_{max}$, both closely approximating the exact solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to better understand the difference in performance between Euler and RK4, an error plot is shown in Figure X for different $\\Delta t_{max}$ values when solving example 1. This shows that RK4 consistently produces more accurate solutions than Euler with the same timestep, enabling RK4 to accurately evaluate the problem faster using larger timesteps. Points are marked on Figure X showing $\\Delta t_{max}$ values where the absolute accuracies are the same, which is $0.000115$ for Euler and $0.312572$ for RK4. Timing these shows Euler taking 127ms, and RK4 taking 1ms, demonstrating the benefit of RK4.\n",

    "#### 1.2 - numerical_shooting.py\n",
    "This file provides the capability of finding orbits within a system. When calling the *orbit_shoot* function, it constructs and solves the shooting root-finding problem for the given system of ODEs. A phase condition can be provided in the form of a function, which is crucial for ensuring a solution is found for autonomous problems. The solving function used to solve for the roots can be specified, however this function is designed specifically for use with scipy.optimize.fsolve for reasons explained in section X.\n",
    "To demonstrate the use of *orbit_shoot*, the predator-prey equations are used, in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{x} = x(1-x) - \\frac{axy}{d+x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{y} = by(1-\\frac{y}{x})$\n",
    "\n",
    "$where: a = 1.0, b = 0.2, d = 0.1$\n",
    "\n",
    "An initial guess of $[0.5,0.5,20]$ and phase condition $\\dot{y} = 0$ are used to identify an orbit, which is found to begin at $x = y = 0.383$ with a period of 20.72 seconds. Figure Xa illustrates the solution to the system of ODEs found using *solve_to* with those starting conditions. Figure Xb shows the same solution with different axes, with the closed loop indicating an true orbit has in fact been found.\n",

    "#### 1.3 - numerical_continuation.py\n",
    "This file contains functions to perform numerical continuation, specifically natural parameter continuation and pseudo-arclength continuation. These allow us to see the change in behaviour of a system as a parameter changes, with *pseudo_arclength* also incorporating the pseudo-arclength equation into the problem. Both functions operate based on a predicted value, calculated from the two previous soluions. First, they are both used to solve the algebraic cubic equation $x^3 - x + c = 0$ as parameter $c$ varies between [-2, 2]. For this problem, a discretisation is not needed, and scipy.optimize.fsolve is used as the solver. Figure X shows that *natural_continuation* fails at the fold bifurcation point as the search line fails to intersect the solution, whereas *pseudo_arclength* is able to continue capturing the behaviour past this point.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Parameter $\\beta$ varies between [0, 2]. Figure X illustrates how *natural_continuation* has the same issue of failing at the fold bifurcation point, but this is now expected. This example shows how discretisation functions can be applied to both methods.\n",

    "#### 1.4 - pde_solver.py\n",
    "This file provides the ability to solve diffusive PDE equations. Different boundary conditions can be specified, which can be of dirichlet, neumann, or robin form. The problem is solved using sparse matrices, and the method used to solve can also be choosen from method of lines, explicit Euler, implicit Euler, or Crank-Nicolson. To demonstrate them, the linear diffusion equation is solved, which is defined by $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$, with boundary conditions $u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0$, initial condition $u(x,0) = \\sin(\\pi x)$, and parameters $D=0.1, N=100$. Note that for implicit Euler and Crank-Nicolson methods, $\\delta t = 0.1$ is used, however the stability condition limits the method of lines and explicit Euler methods to $\\delta t = 0.0005$ is the maximum they are capable of using for this problem. Figure X shows how the method of lines performs very poorly, while the implicit Euler and Crank-Nicolson are very precise. Through experimenting using the function, it is found that altering the initial condition greatly impacts the solution found, so the method of lines can be made to produce an accurate answer at the cost of the other methods subsequently performing poorly.\n",

    "### 2 - Software Design\n",
    "This section describes key software design decisions that were made throughout the development, and how they link towards the overall goal. In order to make the software easy to understand and use, early in the design process a standard format of outputs was decided upon, which is an numpy.ndarray with a row of values for each relevant element being returned, with solved variables always coming first. This was chosen because most of the outputs of the functions within the software are best visualised with a plot. Structuring the outputs like this makes indexing the different elements for the plots easy. An alternative approach could have been to return each element as its own different variable (eg: return x, b) however this was avoided as it makes errors involving unequal length dimensions of the outputs more likely to go unnoticed. Containing everything into the same ndarray makes it easy to ensure the outputs are all consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the formats of the inputs was standardised too to make combining the functions easier. This became especially important in cases such as the numerical continuation functions, which use the *shooting_problem* function from numerical shooting as a discretisation function. Standardising the inputs also makes it easier to combine the PDE solver with numerical continuation using a simple wrapper which the user custom makes for their problem. In cases like these, the documentation of the software becomes the primary source of understanding for the user. This example also demonstrates how certain stages of process were kept in separate functions within files, in cases where another file would use one of the stages. Keeping the functions separate enabled cleaner coding without repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also standardised the format of all the documentation, which is contained at the beginning of each function. This enables the user to quickly scan the text for the specific information they require, which includes input formats, output formats, and a description of what each variable is. An improvement to this would be to include examples of the functions being used, however this was not done because of how poor they look in the text format within the file. This can be overcome by moving the documentation to a different medium, for example on a website or on a separate document within the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gracefully handling errors is key to user-friendly generalised software, therefore a separate file called *input_checks.py* was made, which contains simple functions for checking the format of function inputs before carrying out the function. These feature informative error messages which allow the user to efficiently locate the source of the error, instead of allowing the error to cause a random issue somewhere within the function and return a meaningless error message. Within some functions, custom error handlers are also implemented, for example with decision variables requiring a string input. These check that the string is a valid option, and if not display a list of valid options to choose from. Some inputs are not always required to be in the same input, for example with single ODE equations vs systems of ODEs. The single ODE could have an initial value given as an int or float, however the system requires it to be in a list or ndarray form. To overcome this, I made it so the function always requires it to be given in list or ndarray form, which is simpler for the code to handle however less intuitive for the user. An alternative approach could have been to include an extra check or input variable which indicates the nature of the problem and allows the user more flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "While having the option of various solving methods is useful, for many problems the user simply desires a solution by any means. Therefore, a lot of input parameters have been given default values and functions so that code will still run without the user considering it. For the *solve_to* ODE solving function, RK4 is used as the default after demonstrating more accurate outputs. In cases such as the solving function for *orbit_shoot*, the default is Scipy's *fsolve*, chosen because Scipy functions are far more reliably tested than any functions developed for this coursework. This was also important for optional inputs, such as the various argument lists. In the *solve_pde* function, the use of sparse matrices can be specified by the user, which was only incorporated for my investigations. The default is to use them, due to the greatly enhanced computational efficiency they provide when solving the systems. Improved computational efficiency is also a core reason ndarrays are used as standard throughout the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design decisions around the pde_solver.py file were particularly interesting. During intitial development, the various methods were separated into functions that could be called based on the desired method. However, this resulted in a large amount of repetition and difficulty when refining the code. In order to make it more user-friendly and developer orientated, the methods are now all combined into a single function. To do this, similarities between the matrices used for the solving were identified and base matrices are generated. These are then modified based on the boundary conditions, and the output from the solver is similarly modified. An important drawback of this function is that it only allows you to specify the type of the right boundary condition. The left one is always dirichlet. This happened because all of the problems I was solving when developing the code used dirichlet boundary conditions on the left, which led to a false understanding. This could be ammended by incorporating separate string inputs for the type of each boundary condition, and adding the relevant matrice adjustments into the code. Alternatively, the boundary conditions could have a custom made class containing all this useful unique information, with two objects of that class being input into the *solve_diffusion* function for the boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring the stability of the various functions throughout developement was important, and was achieved using unit tests. All of the unit tests are contained inside one file, called *all_unittests.py*, which enabled easy running after changes were made the structures of functions. These unit tests involve testing each function with problems and checking their outputs against known solutions. Using this allowed me to identify any misfiring code upon changes, and doing so quickly prevented me from becoming dependent on new code when it was faulty.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 3 - Reflective Learning Log\n",
    "This coursework has greatly increased my depth of understanding regarding the mathematics of these processes. I often use various equations and functions without any thought towards the fundamental concept of them, but coding them like this caused me to better appreciate them in order to effectively trouble shoot. I am pursuing a career in AI, therefore understanding the mathematical concepts behind my tools will enable to be produce more tailored and efficient products.\n",
    "\n",
    "My understanding of software engineering practices has also greatly increased. I was already familiar with using GitHub and regularly comitting changes, however my previous code has typically been messy and difficult to interpret. I have found that modularising functions into well-structured and documented files better enables me to return to the work after an extended absence. Being able to read through my thorough notes made it easy to understanding my previous thought processes. Including custom error checking functions within the software also helped greatly with trouble-shooting when applying the functions. Something I was not previously aware of was unit tests, which proved to be an elegant way of checking the functionality of the whole repository at once. In later stages of the development process, optimisation became more significant, and I learnt about useful principles such as sparse matrices and the benefits of numpy.ndarrays over lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The short-term implications of what I have learnt are my understanding of the mathematical processes including numerical continuation, orbit shooting, and solving boundary value problems. This specific knowledge may or may not be useful in the future, but what certainly will be are the software engineering principles I have developed. In real industry, I am more likely to be working in a team rather than solely, so proper formatting and documentation of code is important, as well as clear communication of concepts and thought processes. I found during the pair-coding exercises in the lab sessions that many people approach coding problems in different ways, therefore communication using clear and correct terminology was important for effective work. As well as this, my personal approach to coding problems has been refined signficantly. Before, I used to rush into attempting to create the entire function at once, and then encountering problems in strange orders which made development difficult. Instead, creating a flow chart of processes outside of the IDE first and then approaching them in stages led to a far smoother experience. This flow chart was also very useful when optimising the software, as it enabled me to clearly see overlaps in processes and isolate functions that could be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I were to start this module again, I would have also kept a logbook separate to the python files in the repository. While my notes and documentation made it easier to interpret after absence, these notes were still polluted by the code itself. Having my thought processes towards the overall structure of each function clearly outlined in a separate document would have helped ease this problem, and also prevent planned tasks from getting forgotten with time. I would have also used a wider variety of examples when developing my scripts, primarily to prevent limitations in software capabilities such as the fixed left boundary condition in the PDE solver. Realising this had been neglected at a much earlier stage would have led to feasible implementation within the remaining time-frame I scheduled for this coursework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in future when I am creating work plans for a project, I will leave more time within the deadline stages to account for unforeseen issues. More thorough trialling will also be used during development stages, in order to prevent this kind of oversight. If producing a software package, I will include more detailed documentation on a separate medium to the code files. This would likely be a website, which enables nicely formatted examples to be included, as well as hyperlinks to quickly navigate between relevant functions."
