    "The goal is to produce a software capable of solving single and multi-dimensional systems of ODEs, utilising the Euler and 4th Order Runga-Kutta (RK4) methods integration methods to solve the solution at timesteps. A maximum timestep can be specified which impacts the number of steps the algorithm must take.\n",
    "The first example shows the *solve_to* function evaluating the ODE equation $\\dot{x} = x$, with initial condition $x(0) = 1, t \\in [0,1]$, and $\\Delta t_{max} = 0.05$. Solutions at $x(1)$ are found using Euler and RK4 integration. These are compared to the known solution $x(t) = e^t$ as shown in Figure X. This plot shows the solutions generated using RK4 are accurate enough to be obscured on the graph, while Euler method results in a small under-approximation.\n",

    "The *solve_to* function is also capable of evaluating systems of ODEs. To demonstrate this, the next example solves the ODE $\\ddot{x} = x$, which is equivalent to the system $\\dot{x} = y, \\dot{y} = -x$. The same initial conditions are used, with $x(0) = [1,1], t \\in [0,10]$, and $\\Delta t_{max} = 0.05$. Solutions at $x(1)$ are found and compared to the known solutions $x(t) = cos(t) + sin(t), y(t) = cos(t) - sin(t)$, as shown in Figure X.\n",
