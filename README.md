This repository contains the coursework submission for a module completed during my BEng called Scientific Computing.
The assignment was to create a general numerical continuation software that can track limit-cycles of arbitrary ordinary differential equations and steady states of second-order diffusive PDEs, under variations of a parameter in the system.
I gained a much more thorough understanding of the software design process, including documentation and interfaces between each of the components, so that the resulting code is modular and follows good coding principles such as DRY and unit testing.
